**F1: A graph of the Top 10 countries with most cholera casse**
This bar chart shows the top 10 countries with the most cholera cases. India has the most cases, followed by Haiti. The chart highlights the countries that are most affected by cholera and could be used to inform public health efforts to address this issue. The data suggests that cholera is a global problem that affects a wide range of countries.

**Figure 2: Countries with Cholera cases > 50,000**
The graph depicts the countries with reported cholera cases exceeding 50,000. The countries are arranged in ascending order based on their total case count. The graph serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by cholera. It highlights the countries most affected and emphasizes the need for targeted interventions.

**Figure 3: Global reflection of Cholera cases**
\
The graph shows the global cholera cases over time. We can see that there are several peaks in the number of cases, suggesting outbreaks of cholera. The most significant peak occurred in the early 1990s, followed by another large peak in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The number of cases has generally been declining since the early 2000s.

This graph suggests that cholera is a cyclical disease, with outbreaks occurring periodically.

\
The stacked area chart shows the number of cholera cases in the top 10 countries from 1950 to 2016. The chart shows that the number of cholera cases has been increasing in recent years, particularly in Somalia and Haiti. The chart also shows that the number of cholera cases has been decreasing in some countries, such as India and Mozambique.

**Figure 5: Heatmap of cholera in countries which reported >50,000**

The heatmap highlights the geographic regions most affected by cholera, particularly in Sub- Saharan Africa and parts of Asia. The map suggests that cholera cases have fluctuated over time, with a peak in the 1970s followed by a decline in the 1980s. Countries, such as India and Haiti, have consistently experienced high numbers of cholera cases throughout the period, indicating possible underlying factors contributing to vulnerability.
